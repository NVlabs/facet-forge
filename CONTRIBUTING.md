## FacetForce Contribution Rules

#### Pull Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [upstream](https://github.com/nvlabs/facet-forge) FacetForge repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git FacetForge
# Checkout the targeted branch and commit changes
# Push the commits to a branch on the fork (remote).
git push -u origin <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
  ```

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) (PR) can be [requested](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.
  * While under review, mark your PRs as work-in-progress by prefixing the PR title with [WIP].

4. Since there is no CI/CD process in place yet, the PR will be accepted and the corresponding issue closed only after adequate testing has been completed, manually, by the developer and/or FacetForce engineer reviewing the code.


#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
